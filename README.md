# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview

This project implements a logistic regression model to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. The dataset contains various customer attributes and whether or not they have churned (canceled their service).

## Dataset

The dataset is available in the `data/` directory and contains customer information, including demographic data, account details, and usage statistics. The target variable is `Churn`, indicating whether a customer has left the company.

## Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`

## Requirements

You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt



Results
The script will print the accuracy of the logistic regression model, the confusion matrix, and a classification report providing precision, recall, and F1-score for the churn prediction.

Future Work
Explore additional models, such as Random Forests or Gradient Boosting, for improved accuracy.
Conduct feature selection and engineering to enhance model performance.
Analyze the impact of different customer segments on churn rates.
